# Kalah Project

## Rules
* Kalah is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits that have a large store at either end called kalah. A player owns the six pits closest to him and the kalah on his right side. Beginners may start with three seeds in each pit, but the game becomes more and more challenging by starting with 4, 5 or up to 6 pieces in each pit. Today, four seeds per hole has become the most common variant, but Champion recommended the expert game.

* Play is counterclockwise. The seeds are distributed one by one in the pits and the players own kalah, but not into the opponent's store.

* If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of the player, the move ends without anything being captured.

* If the last seed falls into the player's kalah, he must move again.

* If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, he captures all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in his kalah. If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.

* The game ends when one player no longer has any seeds in any of his holes. The remaining pieces are captured by his adversary. The player who has captured most pieces is declared the winner.
